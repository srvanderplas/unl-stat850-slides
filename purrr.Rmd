## Lists and Vectors

A **vector** is a 1-dimensional data structure that contains several things that are all the same type

```{r}
logical_vec <- c(T, T, F, F)
numeric_vec <- c(3, 1, 4, 5)
character_vec <- c("cats", "rule", "dogs", "drool") 
# not really! but it doesn't make sense if you switch it...
```

We index vectors using single brackets

```{r}
character_vec[c(1, 3)]
character_vec[logical_vec]
```

A **list** is a 1-dimensional data structure that contains ... anything.

```{r}

    c("With", "2", "vectors")),

## Lists and Vectors

Lists can be indexed in 3 different ways:

```{r}
# By name
my_list$second
```

---
## Lists and Vectors

Lists can be indexed in 3 different ways:

```{r}
# By position, using single brackets
my_list[1] # first thing in the list
```

(this returns a list)

---
## Lists and Vectors

Lists can be indexed in 3 different ways:
```{r}
# By position or name, using double brackets
my_list[["first"]]

my_list[[3]]
```

This returns the structure inside the list entry, whatever it is.

## Setup

```{r load-pkgs, eval = F}
library(purrr)
library(repurrrsive) # demo data
```

```{r load-pkgs, eval = T, include = F}
```

```{r}
data(got_chars)
length(got_chars)
names(got_chars[[1]])
```

---
## What's in the list?

```{r}
got_chars[[1]]
```

---
## Introduction to `map`

`map` iterates through each item in the list and applies a function.

There are some shorthands - if you pass in a name, for instance, `map` will pull out that item in the list:

```{r}
map(got_chars, "name")
```

---
## Introduction to `map`

`map` also makes it easy to force output into the form you want it to take:
```{r}
map_chr(got_chars, "name")
```

---
## Introduction to `map`

`map_xxx` will give you an error if you return something of the wrong type

```{r, error = T}
map_dbl(got_chars, "name")
```

`map` is also pipe-friendly

```{r}
map_chr(got_chars, "name") %>% 
  map_int(., nchar)
```

---
## Introduction to `map`

There are other shortcuts, too:

```{r}
map_chr(got_chars, 4)
```

This pulls out the 4th item in each sub-list

## Try it out!

Pull out a character vector of the image URLs for each cat breed
```{r, echo = F}
cat_urls <- map_chr(cats, 2)
```

As a bonus, if you have the `magick` package installed, run this code on your result:
```{r, eval = F}
library(magick)
ims <- map(cat_urls[1:10], image_read) %>% image_join()
image_animate(ims, fps = 2)
```
```{r, echo = F}
library(magick)
```

---
## Introduction to `map`

What if we want to pull out multiple values?

`[` is a function!    
.small[(Or use `magrittr::extract` if it makes you uncomfortable)]

```{r}
tmp <- map(got_chars, `[`, c("name", "gender", "born", "died"))
tmp[[2]]
```

---
## Introduction to `map`

And if we want, we can even get a data frame, as long as each entry has only one line...
```{r}
# There are several extract functions in different pkgs
# use magrittr::extract to get the one we need
map_df(got_chars, magrittr::extract, 
       c("name", "gender", "born", "died"))
```

name:list-cols
## Creating (and using) List columns

```{r}
# What about the characteristics?
cats[[1]]$characteristics 
```

---
## Creating List columns

We could write a function to format the list columns the way we want them to be...

like, maybe in a nice data frame?
```{r}
fix_characteristics <- function(x) 
  tibble(characteristic = names(x), 
         rating = as.numeric(x))


fix_characteristics(cats[[1]]$characteristics)
```

---
## Creating List columns

Then, we can mutate a list-column using map to apply our function to every entry!

```{r}
cat_df <- cat_df %>%
  mutate(characteristics = map(cats, "characteristics") %>% 
           map(fix_characteristics))

select(cat_df, breed, characteristics)
```

---
## Working with List-columns

We can unnest this column if we want each row in the characteristics data frame to have its own row in the main data frame:

```{r}
select(cat_df, breed, characteristics) %>%
  unnest(characteristics) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = characteristic, y = rating)) + 
  geom_violin() + coord_flip()
```

## Try it out

1. Write a function that will convert the cat statistics into a data frame.    
Include columns for min_life_span, max_life_span, min_weight, max_weight, length, and origin.

2. Test your function on one or two cat breeds

3. Use mutate + map to create a list-column with the statistics. 

4. Is there a relationship between breed size and life span?

    min_weight = str_extract(x[[3]], "^\\d{1,}") %>% parse_number,
    max_weight = str_extract(x[[3]], "to \\d{1,}") %>% parse_number,
    length = x[[2]],
    origin = x[[4]]
  )
}

cat_stats(cats[[1]]$stats)
```

unnest(stats) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = max_weight, y = max_life_span)) + 
  geom_jitter(amount = .125) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
```

## Ways to use purrr

- Read in multiple files, fit a model to each dataset

- Create lists of predictor variables, fit a model with those variables to the same dataset and compare

- Keep your data stored in a single data frame, only accessing the pieces you need at any given time

- Run simulations and store the simulation results in a column

- Store the data, data cleaning steps, and model results in a single data frame

---
name:otherfns
## Beyond `map`

- map2 takes two inputs, .x and .y, and applies function(.x, .y) to each combination

- pmap takes a list of inputs and applies a function to each combination

- walk takes inputs and applies a function to them but doesn't store results (useful for e.g. printing out plots)


- lots of other helper functions in `purrr`
